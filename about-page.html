          <p>My name is Kris and I am currently a student at Code Fellows for full-stack web development. I am dedicated  to   learning and helping others learn software development. I fell in love with software development while  on   parental leave when my daughter was born. I knew it was where I wanted to be in 5, 10 , 20 years and I  am   currently looking to fill a role for a  company with a structured mentorship program. I know I have what  it takes   to thrive and I owe it to myself to surpass even my own expectations.</p>

          <p>Hello I'm Marco! I'm currently studying software development with a focus in Advanced Python programming.  My   background of almost 10 years in the service industry allowed me to hone both technical and interpersonal   skills  that grew me into a great speaker, listener, and compassionate teammate. I have a knack for foreign   language   acquisition that pairs well with my  love of traveling and learning about our planet and the people  living on it.   I enjoy helping others; aside from volunteering my time I aim to serve my community and the  world at large by   leveraging my ability to listen, learn fast, and implement creative plans. I believe   programming is a medium  through which I can participate in making the world a better place.</p>

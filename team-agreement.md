Kris Dunning, John Rayome, Dominic Giacona, Faustino Marco Simpliciano

AKA DJKM

## Cooperation Plan

Every person on your team is an asset. This is your chance to discover the hidden strengths and areas for growth for each team member.

Describe at least:

- What are the key strengths of each person on the team?
  - John
    - Excellent speaker
    - Loops
  - Kris
    - JS
    - Code review
    - debugging
    - architechture
  - Dom
    - HTML/CSS
    - Prototyping
    - Design
    - User Stories
    - Branding
    - Logo Design
    - wireframing
  - Marco
    - JS
    - google-fu
- How can you best utilize these strengths in the execution of your project?
  - Our strengths vary enough that we'll be able to help balance out each other's strengths and weaknesses well.
    - Dom will be a huge asset for us in the wireframing and design portion of the project, as well as aesthetics and general design.
    - John is our go-to man for motivation and accountability. He's a great speaker and driven learner; this dedication will carry our group through to the finish line.
    - Kris' strength in code review and debugging will be invaluable when it comes to sharing our progress with one another and developing working code. We'll have a better ability than others might to get "un-stuck" thanks to this aspect of Kris' abilities alone.
    - Marco is strong in logic problems and researching solutions. This may serve to balance out site functionality issues where other team members would opt to defer to a logic-driven dev, as opposed to CSS/design.

- In which professional competencies do you each want to develop greater strength?
  - Dom
    - JS
  - John
    - JS
  - Kris
    - GitHub
  - Marco
    - CSS
- Knowing that every person in your team needs to understand all aspects of the project, how do you plan to approach the day-to-day work?
  - Stand-ups each morning during project week. We'll aim to get onto the same page re: goals, recent achievements, prohibitive issues.
  - We'll at least start with some pair-programming, modeling, and wireframing. 
  - We're aiming to be on the same page as far as the specific work we each have to get done in small sprints. 
  - Midday check-ins, and end-of-day check-ins will benefit the overall goal by keeping us up to speed on the progress of the progject. 
  - Luckily, we're already well acquainted as fellow students and familiar with basic work-styles and helping eachother out of troublesome coding problems.
  - We also motivate each other pretty well, which bodes well for the achieveability of our goals.
  - We plan to manage divergence of ideas with a standard majority vote.
  - The project board will help us manage accountability for the execution of designated tasks.

## CONFLICT PLAN

- What will be your group’s process to resolve conflict, when it arises?
  - When it comes to disagreements regarding a fork in the road, we plan to have team 
  discussions and majority votes. 

- What will your team do if one person is taking over the project and not letting the other members contribute?
  - We're lucky in that we've already had some time to develop healthy communication patterns between us, and if communication should break down, we'll resort to using the assistance of our instructor and TA's.

- How will you approach each other and the challenges of the project knowing that it is impossible for all members to be at the exact same place in understanding and skill level?
  - We'll allocate our resources and tasks in a way that allows us to play to our individual strengths, and uphold this process with clear communication and teamwork.

- How will you raise concerns to members who are not adequately contributing?
  - Discuss it with that team member, and if we're unable to get that member to where we need them to be, we'll offer alternatives to the work they're struggling to complete. If that should prove ineffective then we plan to consult TA's and our instructor.
  - Above all, good clear communication between us ought to help figure out why a member of our team is struggling, and efficiently re-allocate work to better suit our needs and abilities. 

- How and when will you escalate the conflict if your resolution attempts are unsuccessful?
  - We'll seek out the help of TA's and Audrey via slack message, after exhausting alternative internal solutions. 

- Communication Plan
  - What hours will you be available to communicate?
    - Regular class hours
  - What platforms will you use to communicate (ie. Slack, phone …)?
    - Slack, remo
  - How often will you take breaks?
    - Hourly breaks, 10 minutes
    - As needed breaks, communicating return times if during class hours.
  - What is your plan if you start to fall behind?
    - Communicate with the group, let the others know immediately if any of us discover that we're falling behind anticipated task-schedule.
  - How will you communicate after hours and on the weekend?
    - Open to receiving messages from one another outside of class hours, but upholding an agreement that none of us will hold one another responsible for responding to any messages sent or received outside class hours.

  - What is your strategy for ensuring everyone’s voice is heard?
    - Daily stand-ups, 2-3 times per day, open video chat at our table.

  - How will you ensure that you are creating a safe environment where everyone feels comfortable speaking up?
    - We have a pre-established rapport with one another that has already developed a trust between us to have an open-floor communication environment as a team.
  
## WORK PLAN

  - How you will identify tasks, assign tasks, know when they are complete, and manage work in general?

    - We'll communicate thoroughly to develop a plan with detailed user stories and problem domain.

    - Extensive work in this portion of our process will serve us to avoid the need to be creative in congruence with our work.
      - A solid plan will allow us to interchangeably progress different stories.

    - 
  - What project management tool will be used?
    - GitHub project management tool
    - Trello is also an option

        - code
        - ACP
        - Get approval for PR's

  - Will you be using a PR review workflow? If so, consider:
  - How many people must review a PR?
    - 2 people
  - Who merges PRs?
